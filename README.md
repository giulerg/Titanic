# Titanic

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a predictive model for classification. It includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building and evaluation
- Insights and conclusions

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating models

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle's [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). It includes information about passengers such as age, gender, and class, along with the target variable (`Survived`).
